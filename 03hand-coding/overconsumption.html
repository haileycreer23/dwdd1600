        <h1>Overconsumption</h1>
        <p><b>the action or fact of consuming something to excess</b></p> 
       <p>Overconsumption, the rapid consumption of cheap products that a buyer does not truly need, is fueled by social media “hauls” and reviews and has caused great damage to our consumer culture. A quick scroll on any media platform: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, will likely result in being bombarded with ads or review videos, showing you all the things you “have to have.”
While fashion trends have always existed, social media has dramatically escalated the speed of these trends. Before social media became popular, fashion trends would usually last five to ten years. In the past, trends were carefully curated and modeled by famous singers, actresses or political figures. Now, trends are created by influencers with a social media presence or someone who just happened to go viral. These short-lived trends, called “micro trends,” promote overconsumption.Micro trends make people think that they need everything they see on social media. The ever-increasing persistence of social media has further aided the increase in micro trends.</p>
