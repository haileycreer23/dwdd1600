        <p> We began our second hand journey at the beginning of our freshman year at Utah Valley University, where we found many household items, and clothing were cheap and overpriced. This is where we began the idea of giving second hand items a real second life, and to fight against our modern day overconsumption.<em> This is a space dedicated to the appreciation and the re-selling of vintage and second hand items to fight against modern day consumerism.</em></p>
       
       <h2><a href="Overconsumption.Html#fight">How To Shop Sustainably</a></h2>
       <p> We understand how changing to more sustainable ways to shop can be difficult, so here are some things to look for.</p>
       <ul>
     <li>Be mindful: only buy what you need, when you need it. Even if “the price is right."</li>
            <li>Make a list of items that you need and host a clothing swap with friends. Trading items is a great way to find new pieces, and that way those thrift store pieces can be saved for those who truly need them.</li>
           <li>If you can afford to, shop sustainably. Investing in those staple pieces is a great way to be anti-consumerist, because you’ll be more conscious of how much you spend on a piece. Truly sustainable shops also only put out a select number of new pieces per season (that don’t always follow modern trends and are timeless), or run on a made-to-order basis. Many times, these shops have payment plans, or sales, though they encourage saving sales for those who truly need to shop sale.</li>
